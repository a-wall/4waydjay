=== 4-way D-jay ===

"4-way D-jay" explores the idea of crossfading in 2-dimensions instead of the more conventional 1-dimension.

The creative and fun side to playing two tracks simulataneously is the sonic interplay that occurs during crossfading. The standard approach is to have crossfading between 2 tracks. Here we extend the idea to crossfading 4 tracks and take advantage of the different interactions made possible by handheld devices. 

The target scenario for this type of visual interaction with audio is casual dj-ing, where the person controlling the mix doesn't require any experience to create interesting audio.

=== Getting Started ===
Open a browser at: wallspace.no-ip.org/4waydj
Press anywhere (off the circular marker) to play/pause.
Drag the marker around to change the mix.
How close the marker is to each side determines the gain of a track in the overall mix.

Please note: "4-way D-jay" has been tested in Chrome and on an iPhone running iOS 6 (it won't work on iOS 5).

=== Future Features ===
* Track selection
* Controlling the mix using a physics engine and accelerometers
* Spectrum display in the side panels
* Beat detection
